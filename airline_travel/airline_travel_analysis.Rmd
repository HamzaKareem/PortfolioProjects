## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## CONCLUSION
```{r}
#To summarize, airlines that want to maximize profitability must analyze revenue data, such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft. By assessing these indicators, airlines can identify areas for improvement and adjust their pricing and route plans.

#One important factor that can improve profitability is a higher occupancy rate. This allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing the costs associated with empty seats. Airlines should adjust the price for each aircraft, as both low and high prices can discourage people from buying tickets. The price should be reasonable and reflect the condition and facilities of the aircraft. It should not be too cheap or too expensive.

#It is important to note that boosting occupancy rates should not come at the expense of customer satisfaction or safety. Airlines must strike a balance between the need for profit and the importance of providing high-quality service and upholding safety regulations. By adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization, airlines can achieve long-term success in a highly competitive industry.
